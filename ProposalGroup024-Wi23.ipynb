    "Our goal is to create a multi-class classification model to determine the genre of novel songs based on our database of roughly 18,000 songs described with 15 numerical features. The original dataset was used in an online Hackathon. Our performance will be measured by implementing a log-loss metric and this can be cross referenced with the winners of the original competition as well as submissions from Kaggle where the dataset was made publicly available."

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "With the onset of streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music, people are constantly listening to music and trying to expand their music taste. As access to music has increased, classification between different genres of music has become much more important to the general population as the number of genres increase. There are 10 major classifications of music: <br>\n",
    "1. Pop\n",
    "2. Rock\n",
    "3. Indie Rock\n",
    "4. EDM\n",
    "5. Jazz\n",
    "6. Country\n",
    "7. Hip Hop & Rap\n",
    "8. Classical Music\n",
    "9. Latin Music\n",
    "10. K-pop <a name = 'analyticsteps'></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#analyticstep).\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Using machine learning to help classify music genres is a relatively new concept, but is something that has been shown to have great potential, especially in the realm of recommendations. Previous work to classify into different categories has been done with different types of models, such as one example with a convoluted neural network. This particular method used audio signals to determine the genre. The particular dataset that was used contained a csv with many different quantifications of the particular song, as well as an audio recording of that song. From the audio recording, they examined the wav graphs in conjunction with the numerical data. From this data they constructed their classifier which worked with 92.93% accuracy. <a name = 'clairvoyant'></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#clairvoyant). <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "From Kaggle, we can also see many other projects that were completed. These projects use different types of machine learning models in order to classify the different songs into genres. One of the algorithms did some clustering using PCA and TSNEs to cluster the data into different points. Another algorithm used a random forest to classify the different songs into genres. All of these different methods had high accuracy, and developed a recommendation system once the model was trained and complete to recommend songs to users <a name=\"kaggle\"></a> [<sup>[3]</sup>](#kaggle).\n"

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Our problem revolves around classifying songs into different music genres. For many listeners of music, a large issue is discovering new music that fits into genres the user is interested in. Users do not want to have to listen to many new songs in order to just find music in their genre, then narrowing down even further into music that fits their taste. By creating a classifier that can group music into different genres, we can help create better music recommendations for users looking to discover new songs."

The data is already split into training and testing csvs, with ~18000 observations in the training set and ~7,700 observations in the testing set. The features for each observation consist of quantitative variables such as key, tempo, time signature, as well as qualitative variables such as liveness, danceability, and speechiness. The data is already quite clean, with no missing data and all fields are numerical, so pre-processing will be minimal.\n",
