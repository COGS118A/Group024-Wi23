    "Our goal is to create a multi-class classification model to determine the genre of novel songs based on our database of roughly 18,000 songs described with 15 numerical features. The original dataset was used in an online Hackathon. Our performance will be measured by implementing a log-loss metric and this can be cross referenced with the winners of the original competition as well as submissions from Kaggle where the dataset was made publicly available."

So use the method that works for you, but do use inline citations.\n",

    "\n",
    "Our problem revolves around classifying songs into different music genres. For many listeners of music, a large issue is discovering new music that fits into genres the user is interested in. Users do not want to have to listen to many new songs in order to just find music in their genre, then narrowing down even further into music that fits their taste. By creating a classifier that can group music into different genres, we can help create better music recommendations for users looking to discover new songs."

The data is already split into training and testing csvs, with ~18000 observations in the training set and ~7,700 observations in the testing set. The features for each observation consist of quantitative variables such as key, tempo, time signature, as well as qualitative variables such as liveness, danceability, and speechiness. The data is already quite clean, with no missing data and all fields are numerical, so pre-processing will be minimal.\n",
